Baby stop playin'
My heart is aching
Trusting you now
Who's the fool,now?
Maybe tomorrow
Will wash all our sorrows
Come to me now
You're home to me now

FPB LAW$:
If you're the star girl
I will be your shooter
You be shooting star
I make a wish we'd stay together
I can be your waffle
And you can be my butter
If we be together,girl
I know we taste more better
If you got the power girl
I can be your ranger
I will kill all the villian
And you'll be safe from danger
You are looking good
And I know you are so fragile
Oh God please wake me up
Am i dreaming of an angel?
Imma kiss your hand
Hug me while you can
Ya Ya Ya
Cantik tertarik menarik kau memang debomb
And you're looking so good
I put your picture in my phone
Menarik tertarik tercantik
Aku kena bomb
Hari-hari *teh tarik*
Sampai jadi banyak foam
Hey la la la la la la
Hey yeah
Lihat bulan di pagar bintang
Bintangnya rindukan seorang
Rindu pada mu

You're the only face I wanna find
In a crowded place
I wish I was stronger than my mind
I dive in anyways
You're the only face I wanna find
In a crowded place
I wish I was stronger than my mind
I dive in anyways
Oh baby Im hallucinating
With your thoughts on my mind
Intoxicated by your feelings
You make a girl like me to stop and stare
When it comes to you,boy
I dont wanna share
Kinder Bueno,Kisses
You taste so good like chocolate
Sweet lullaby,fine as hell
Eat ice-cream with our pj's
Im your Bonie,
We lit like matches
You're my Clyde Boy
We stick like patches
Imma kiss your hand
Hug me while you can
You're the only face I wanna find
In a crowded place
I wish I was stronger than my mind
I dive in anyways

FPB LAW$:
I know 8×
I missin,missin,missin,missin you
I missin,missin,miss you
Please dont go
I said please dont go,away
Please dont go
Please dont go

Baby stop playin'
My heart is aching
Trusting you now
Who's the fool,now?
Maybe tomorrow
Will wash all our sorrows
Come to me now
You're home to me now
